description: Top 3 cool things from Google Cloud Summit Sydney 2017
---

Just to give a little context, this is my first blog post. I am a Software Engineer and work transforming business using AI. I had the pleasure of attending this year's Google Cloud Summit last week here in Sydney. Have to say
the event was fantastic, great presentation space, catering I have been to quite a few similar conferences this year definetly put Google Cloud at the top both in terms of experience and the value of knowledge I got out of the day. Overall the break out sessions were broken up into three streams. Don't ask me what the other two where cose I was sure which one I'd choose from the moment I registered.

Ofcourse I attended the Machine Learning track, ... who wouldnt?. I have to say breakouts and all the presentations were
very well delivered. Technical enough for me not to get bored or set off my bullshit detector yet also focused 
on business use cases and outcomes not just shinny toys or buzz words. All the presenter most of whom were Google Customer Engineers or Developer Advocates, had a chat with of few of them throughout the day and every one of them was friendly and eager to help. I must say a persectivie user and customer of Google cloud it gave me a lot of confidence and it was awesome to just geek out about the latest tech.
